# `rig.yaml` — declarative config schema

`rig.yaml` is the committed, reproducible source of truth for a repo's setup. `rig apply`
reads it, computes the diff vs disk, and converges. `rig setup` writes it.

**Cascade (by location, no scope flag):**

1. **Global** — `~/.config/rig/config.yaml` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rig/config.yaml`).
2. **Per-repo** — `./rig.yaml` (overrides global; committed by default).

Dicts merge recursively (per-repo wins); lists and scalars replace wholesale. The result
is validated **fail-closed** before any write: unknown top-level keys, unknown categories,
bad enum values, and unknown item names abort.

**Round-trip invariant:** `setup` → `rig.yaml` → `apply --config` produces the same plan.
`riglib/state.py` (`SetupState`) is the single serializer; `riglib/config.py` the loader.

## Top-level shape

```yaml
version: 1                      # schema version (int, required; only 1 supported)
scope: user | repo | both       # advisory label for where installs default (default: both)

defaults:                       # cross-category fallback targets/policy
  skills_target: ~/.agents/skills
  hooks_target: ~/.claude/hooks
  ci_target: .github/workflows
  mcp_target: ~/.claude/mcp
  on_conflict: skip | overwrite | backup   # what apply does when a target exists (default: backup)

agent_tools_source: ~/xp/agent-tools   # the agent-tools checkout to apply FROM (default: auto-detect)

skills: { ... }
agent_hooks: { ... }
git_hooks: { ... }
ci: { ... }
mcp: { ... }
harness: { ... }              # agent harness auto/permission provisioning (auto-mode)
models: { ... }               # daily model-freshness checker schedule (launchd/crontab cron)
```

If `agent_tools_source` is omitted, rig resolves it from `$RIG_AGENT_TOOLS_SOURCE`, then
the default candidates (`~/xp/agent-tools`, `~/work/agent-tools`, `~/agent-tools`).

## Resolution rules (so the file stays terse)

- A category sets `enabled: false` to disable the whole category in one line.
- A category may set `all: true` and list exceptions in `disable: [...]`, **or** `all:
  false` and list only what is enabled in `enable: [...]`. Opt-out and opt-in are both
  expressible.
- Per-item overrides live under `items:` keyed by item name; absent items inherit the
  `all`/`enable`/`disable` decision.
- Targets resolve item → category `target` → `defaults.<x>_target` → built-in default.

## `skills`

```yaml
skills:
  enabled: true
  target: ~/.agents/skills          # or ~/.claude/skills | ./.agents/skills | custom
  universal:
    all: true                       # all universal skills (opt-out model)
    disable: [push-regularly]       # ...except these
  by_type:
    enable: [backend, cli]          # install these by-type bundles wholesale
    items:
      by-type/bot/russian-pluralization: { enabled: false }   # fine-grained override
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | install skills at all |
| `target` | path | `~/.agents/skills` | where SKILL.md dirs are copied |
| `universal.all` | bool | `true` | enable all universal skills (opt-out) |
| `universal.disable` / `universal.enable` | list[str] | `[]` | deltas on `all` |
| `by_type.enable` | list[str] | the detected project type | which `by-type/<kind>` bundles to install whole |
| `by_type.items.<by-type/kind/name>.enabled` | bool | inherited | per-skill override |

If `by_type.enable` is empty and the detected project type is known, that type's bundle is
auto-pulled.

---

## `agent_hooks`

```yaml
agent_hooks:
  enabled: true
  target: ~/.claude/hooks
  target_kind: claude-code          # claude-code | generic (logical point → harness event)
  all: true
  items:
    block-no-verify:     { enabled: true,  on_error: closed }
    enforce-timeout-on-bash: { enabled: true, on_error: open }
```

| Per-item key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | install this hook |
| `on_error` | `open`/`closed` | descriptor's value | fail policy (security = closed) |

The install action always writes an **absolute** `cmd` (rewriting the
`/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/...` placeholder to the script's real path in the agent-tools checkout),
per the `agents-hooks/v1` contract.

---

## `git_hooks`

v0.1 ships the **global dispatcher** (the headline feature — your hooks run in every repo,
even ones that hijack `core.hooksPath`). Per-repo hook templates are deferred to v0.2.

```yaml
git_hooks:
  dispatcher:
    enabled: true
    dir: ~/.config/git/global-hooks.d         # drop-in fragments dir
    runner: ~/.config/git/run-global-hooks     # the dispatcher script
    set_global_hooks_path: true                # set global core.hooksPath (records prior value)
    install_local_retrofit_script: true        # put install-local-hooks.sh on ~/.local/bin
    fragments:
      secret-scan:         { enabled: true }
      conventional-commit: { enabled: false }
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dispatcher.enabled` | bool | `false` | install the global-hook dispatcher |
| `dispatcher.dir` | path | `~/.config/git/global-hooks.d` | fragments dir |
| `dispatcher.runner` | path | `~/.config/git/run-global-hooks` | the runner |
| `dispatcher.set_global_hooks_path` | bool | `true` | wire it as global `core.hooksPath` (backs up the prior value into the action note) |
| `dispatcher.install_local_retrofit_script` | bool | `true` | put `install-local-hooks.sh` on PATH |

---

## `ci`

```yaml
ci:
  enabled: true
  target: .github/workflows        # or `export-only` (record choices, write no files)
  all: false
  items:
    secret-scan:       { enabled: true,  tier: block }
    codeql:            { enabled: true,  tier: block, variant: selfgate }
    dependency-review: { enabled: true,  tier: block }
    leftover-grep:     { enabled: true,  tier: block }
    review-threads:    { enabled: true,  tier: block }
    ship:
      enabled: true
      install_to: ~/bin              # ship is a client command, not a workflow
      gh_alias: true                 # gh alias set ship
```

| Per-item key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | per-item | install this gate |
| `tier` | `block`/`warn` | `block` | enforcement strength (recorded; the workflow itself encodes it) |
| `variant` | str | — | e.g. codeql `selfgate` selects `workflow-selfgate.yml` |
| `install_to` / `gh_alias` | path/bool | — | ship-specific (it is a client command) |

`target: export-only` records the choices without writing files (an agent applies later or
a non-GitHub CI uses each slot's `*.sh`).

---

## `mcp`

```yaml
mcp:
  enabled: true
  target: ~/.claude/mcp            # or ./.mcp.json | export-only
  items:
    review:
      enabled: true
      command: "review --mcp"      # the launch command merged into the harness MCP config
    code-search:
      enabled: true
      server: serena
      command: ""                  # no command → nothing to register (reported, not an error)
```

The install action merges an MCP entry **idempotently by server name** into
`<target>/mcp.json` (or the target file if it ends in `.json`) and never overwrites an
existing differing entry unless `defaults.on_conflict: overwrite`.

---

## `harness`

Provisions the **agent harness's auto/permission mode** as part of the reconciler. With a
`harness:` block, `rig apply` writes the harness's permission setting so **auto-mode**
(the agent runs autonomously, auto-accepting tool calls, with minimum babysitting) is part
of the reproducible config — not a manual per-machine toggle. **Recommended on by default**:
auto-mode is safe because the agent-hook guards (`block-secrets-write`, `block-no-verify`,
`enforce-timeout-on-bash`, `block-raw-process-env`, `block-raw-pr-merge`) are installed in
the same apply and catch the dangerous tool calls before the side effect.

```yaml
harness:
  enabled: true
  kind: claude-code            # claude-code (implemented) | opencode (documented, reserved)
  auto_mode: true              # true → auto-accept tool calls; false → interactive prompts
  # mode: bypassPermissions    # optional: pin the exact mode value (overrides the auto_mode map)
  # settings_path: .claude/settings.json   # where to write (repo-local default; committed)
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | provision the harness setting (set `false` to leave the harness config untouched) |
| `kind` | `claude-code` | `claude-code` | which harness to write. `opencode` is documented-but-reserved → fails closed until implemented |
| `auto_mode` | bool | `false` (scaffold writes `true`) | `true` = auto-accept; maps to the harness's non-interactive permission value |
| `mode` | str | — | pin the exact permission value (e.g. `acceptEdits`), overriding the `auto_mode` mapping |
| `settings_path` | path | `.claude/settings.json` | the settings file to merge into (repo-relative default keeps it committed/reproducible) |

**What gets written.** For `kind: claude-code`, rig merges `permissions.defaultMode` into
the settings JSON — `auto_mode: true` → `bypassPermissions` (auto-accepts every tool call),
`auto_mode: false` → `default` (interactive prompts). Only that one key is touched; every
other setting in the file is preserved. The write is **idempotent** (a re-apply with the
same value is a no-op) and **backup-noted** (a differing prior value is backed up per
`defaults.on_conflict` before converging). `rig status` reports drift if the on-disk value
no longer matches the config.

**opencode equivalent (documented, not yet written by rig).** opencode expresses the same
intent through a `permission` block in its `opencode.json` — e.g.
`"permission": { "edit": "allow", "bash": "allow" }` for auto-accept, vs `"ask"` for
interactive. A config with `kind: opencode` is rejected with a clear "not implemented yet"
message rather than silently doing nothing, so you are never misled into thinking rig wrote
a setting it didn't.

---

## `models`

Provisions a **daily cron that runs the agent-tools model-freshness checker**
(`lib/checker/model_freshness.py`), which polls provider model-list endpoints and proposes
version bumps to the model board (`agent-tools/lib/contracts/models.yaml`). Per the
provisioning rule, on **`rig init` AND `rig apply`** rig **checks whether the schedule is
installed and installs it if missing** (idempotent — a re-apply that finds it present and
current is a no-op).

```yaml
models:
  enabled: true                # provision the daily checker schedule (false → leave system cron alone)
  schedule:
    time: "12:00"              # daily run time, HH:MM 24h (default: noon)
    # label: ai.hyperide.model-freshness   # launchd Label / crontab sentinel (advanced)
  # checker_path: ~/xp/agent-tools/lib/checker/model_freshness.py   # default: resolved from agent_tools_source
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `true` (scaffold) | provision the daily schedule (set `false` to leave the system cron untouched) |
| `schedule.time` | `HH:MM` | `12:00` (noon) | daily run time, 24-hour; fail-closed on a malformed/out-of-range value |
| `schedule.label` | str | `ai.hyperide.model-freshness` | the launchd Label / crontab sentinel identity (one string across platforms) |
| `checker_path` | path | resolved from `agent_tools_source` | the `model_freshness.py` the schedule runs |

**Cross-platform.** The CTO asked for a "cron"; rig provisions the platform-native
equivalent:

- **macOS → launchd.** A `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<label>.plist` with a daily
  `StartCalendarInterval` (Hour/Minute), loaded via `launchctl load`. (cron is
  deprecated/unmanaged on macOS; launchd is the supported scheduler.)
- **Linux → crontab.** A single managed crontab line `MIN HOUR * * * python3 <checker>`,
  fenced by a `# rig-managed: <label>` sentinel comment so it is idempotent (re-apply finds
  it by sentinel) and removable, and so it never disturbs the user's other crontab lines.

**Idempotency (the "проверять есть ли крон и устанавливать" rule).** Both `init` and `apply`
run this. A present-and-current schedule re-applies as a no-op (`skipped`); a missing or
drifted one is (re)installed. `rig status` reports the schedule explicitly (installed /
drifted / not configured) and surfaces a wrong run time or checker path as drift; `rig
doctor` flags a missing scheduler binary (`launchctl`/`crontab`).

Set `RIG_SCHEDULE_DRY_RUN=1` to write the artifact file but **skip the live daemon mutation**
(no `launchctl load`, no `crontab` write) — for CI, containers, or smoke tests where touching
the real per-user scheduler is unwanted.

---

## Validation

`apply`/`status`/`setup`/`init` validate before touching disk and **fail closed** on:
unknown top-level keys, unsupported `version`, invalid `scope` / `on_conflict` / ci `tier` /
agent-hook `on_error`, an unknown or reserved `harness.kind`, a non-bool `harness.auto_mode`,
a malformed/out-of-range `models.schedule.time` or unknown `models` key, and an
`agent_tools_source` that is not an agent-tools checkout. `--dry-run` prints the
resolved plan and exits 0 without writing.
