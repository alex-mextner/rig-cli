# AGENTS.md — rig-cli

Rules for agents working in this repo. English only (no Cyrillic anywhere in repo docs).

## What this is

`rig` is the dev-environment umbrella driver: a standalone Python CLI that sets up a repo
from a committed `rig.yaml` by applying `agent-tools` content (skills, agent-hooks,
git-hook dispatcher, CI gates, MCP) and provisioning the agent harness's auto/permission
mode. It is a peer to `tg-cli` / `review-cli`, not part of `agent-tools` — it *consumes*
agent-tools read-only.

**`rig init` is THE documented front door** — first-run setup (scaffold `rig.yaml` →
apply). It is a thin synonym of `rig setup`: both dispatch to the same handler, so init can
never drift from setup. Keep `setup` working; never make `init` a second engine.

## Hard rules

- **Stdlib-only at import time.** Every `riglib/*` module imports only the standard library
  when loaded. Heavy/optional deps — `yaml`, `textual` — are imported lazily inside the
  function that needs them. `rig --help` and `rig doctor` must run with zero third-party
  imports. Do not add a top-level `import yaml`/`import textual`.
- **One engine, two front-ends.** `rig setup` (wizard) and `rig apply` must share the same
  `plan.build` + `actions.run_plan`. Never fork the executor for the TUI. If you add a
  capability, add it to the headless engine first and let the wizard call it. `rig init` is
  a name alias of `setup` over the SAME handler — not a third path.
- **Harness auto-mode is provisioned through the reconciler, like every other target.** The
  `harness:` block flows config → `plan.build` (one `apply_harness` action) → `run_plan`
  (`actions/runner.py::_do_apply_harness`), writing only the managed permission key into the
  harness settings JSON, idempotent + backup-on-conflict, with drift surfaced by `rig
  status`. Recommend `auto_mode: true` by default — it is safe *because* the agent-hook
  guards (incl. `block-raw-pr-merge`) are installed in the same apply. claude-code is
  implemented; opencode is documented-but-reserved (validation fails closed on it).
- **`rig.yaml` is committed by default.** It is the reproducible source of truth. Do not
  add an "is rig.yaml optional?" flag. Global config lives at `~/.config/rig/config.yaml`;
  per-repo `rig.yaml` overrides it; scope is by location, never a flag.
- **Drift is surfaced both ways, never silently reconciled.** `rig apply` converges
  config→disk only. `disk→config` extras are reported, never auto-deleted.
- **Actions are idempotent and backup-noted.** A re-apply with the same config changes
  nothing (copies skip-if-identical, `core.hooksPath` checks current value, MCP merges are
  keyed). Anything replaced is backed up per `on_conflict` (skip|overwrite|backup) and the
  restore path recorded in the result. Fail-closed on validation; fail-explicit on IO.
- **Agent-hook `cmd` is always written absolute.** The `agents-hooks/v1` runner rejects
  relative paths; the install action rewrites the `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/...` placeholder to
  the real script path in the agent-tools checkout.

## The integration seam (agent-tools)

`riglib/catalog.py` is the only module that knows the agent-tools on-disk layout. It scans
a checkout (`agent_tools_source` → `$RIG_AGENT_TOOLS_SOURCE` → default candidates) into a
flat `Item` registry. If agent-tools changes its layout, fix it *here* — nothing else
should hard-code agent-tools paths.

## Tests

- `python -m pytest -q` — the unit suite. Fast, hermetic; uses a fake agent-tools checkout
  (`tests/conftest.py::fake_agent_tools`) and `tmp_path` — tests never touch the real HOME
  or a real agent-tools checkout.
- `bash tests/smoke.sh` — end-to-end: `--help`, `doctor`, a headless `setup` against a
  sample config in a throwaway repo with an isolated `HOME`, idempotency, status, pytest.
  Needs a real agent-tools checkout (`RIG_AGENT_TOOLS_SOURCE`); self-skips the apply leg
  without one.
- Add a test with every behavior change. TDD red-first is the house style.

## Style

- Conventional commits.
- English-only code, comments, and docs.
- No dead code, no underscore-prefixed unused params, no `as-unknown-as` escape hatches.
- Keep `cli.py` thin (argparse + dispatch); behavior lives in the sibling modules.
